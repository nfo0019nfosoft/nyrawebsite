          <h3>ADVANCED CATARACT SURGERIES</h3>
          <p>
            Advanced cataract surgery typically refers to techniques and technologies
            <span class="eye-text-extra">
              used to improve the safety, precision, and outcomes of cataract removal procedures. Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries globally and involves removing the cloudy lens of the eye and replacing it with an artificial lens implant. Advanced cataract surgery aims to provide patients with improved visual outcomes, faster recovery times, and reduced dependency on glasses or contact lenses, ultimately enhancing their quality of life. However, the suitability of these advanced techniques depends on various factors, including the patient's eye health, lifestyle, and preferences, and should be discussed with our qualified ophthalmologist Dr.Kirtana

          <h3>CORNEA</h3>
          <p>
            Cornea treatments have evolved significantly, offering hope and improved
            <span class="eye-text-extra">
              vision to individuals with corneal diseases or injuries. The cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye, plays a critical role in focusing your vision. When it's damaged through injury, disease, or infection, it can lead to vision problems or even blindness. Here's an overview of various corneal treatments, from conservative approaches to advanced surgical procedures: Advancements in corneal treatments continue to emerge, including novel drug therapies, gene therapy, and bioengineered corneas. These innovations aim to offer more effective, less invasive options for patients with corneal diseases, potentially improving outcomes and reducing the need for surgery. When dealing with corneal issues, the choice of treatment depends on the specific condition, its severity, and the patient's overall health. Our Qualified Ophthalmologist Dr.Kirtana can provide guidance on the best approach based on individual needs.

              (non-cancerous) growth of the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the clear tissue covering the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids. Pterygia are often found on the side of the eye closest to the nose and can grow onto the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye). They are believed to be caused primarily by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, as well as by dry eye and environmental irritants such as dust and wind.

          <h3>HYSTERECTOMY</h3>
          <p>
            A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus. There are several reasons why someone might undergo a hysterectomy, like given below
            <span class="genlap-extra">
              Uterine fibroids: These are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can cause pain, heavy bleeding, and other symptoms. Endometriosis: This is a condition where the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, leading to pain and other complications. Uterine prolapse: This occurs when the uterus slips from its normal position into the vaginal canal. Gynecologic cancer: In cases of uterine, ovarian, or cervical cancer, a hysterectomy may be recommended as part of treatment.

Elective surgeries are planned surgeries done in a new born child. Inguinal hernia is swelling seen in the groin of the child especially when the child cries or strains. It reduces when the child is sleeping. Surgery is required in the newborn period because there is a higher risk of complications in them such as obstruction of the small intestine requiring emergency surgery.
