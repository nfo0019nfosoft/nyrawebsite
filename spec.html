          <h3>ADVANCED CATARACT SURGERIES</h3>
          <p>
            Advanced cataract surgery typically refers to techniques and technologies
            <span class="eye-text-extra">
              used to improve the safety, precision, and outcomes of cataract removal procedures. Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries globally and involves removing the cloudy lens of the eye and replacing it with an artificial lens implant. Advanced cataract surgery aims to provide patients with improved visual outcomes, faster recovery times, and reduced dependency on glasses or contact lenses, ultimately enhancing their quality of life. However, the suitability of these advanced techniques depends on various factors, including the patient's eye health, lifestyle, and preferences, and should be discussed with our qualified ophthalmologist Dr.Kirtana

          <h3>CORNEA</h3>
          <p>
            Cornea treatments have evolved significantly, offering hope and improved
            <span class="eye-text-extra">
              vision to individuals with corneal diseases or injuries. The cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye, plays a critical role in focusing your vision. When it's damaged through injury, disease, or infection, it can lead to vision problems or even blindness. Here's an overview of various corneal treatments, from conservative approaches to advanced surgical procedures: Advancements in corneal treatments continue to emerge, including novel drug therapies, gene therapy, and bioengineered corneas. These innovations aim to offer more effective, less invasive options for patients with corneal diseases, potentially improving outcomes and reducing the need for surgery. When dealing with corneal issues, the choice of treatment depends on the specific condition, its severity, and the patient's overall health. Our Qualified Ophthalmologist Dr.Kirtana can provide guidance on the best approach based on individual needs.

          <p>
            Pterygium surgery is a procedure performed to remove a pterygium, which is a benign
            <span class="eye-text-extra">
              (non-cancerous) growth of the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the clear tissue covering the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids. Pterygia are often found on the side of the eye closest to the nose and can grow onto the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye). They are believed to be caused primarily by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, as well as by dry eye and environmental irritants such as dust and wind.

          <h3>VARICOSE VEINS</h3>
          <p>
            Varicose veins are enlarged, swollen, and twisted veins, often appearing blue or dark purple in color. They usually
            <span class="genlap-extra">
              occur in the legs and can cause discomfort, pain, or aching sensation. Varicose veins happen when the valves inside the veins weaken or fail to work properly, causing blood to pool or flow backward instead of moving toward the heart. Risk factors for varicose veins include genetics, age, gender (women are more prone), obesity, pregnancy, prolonged standing or sitting, and a history of blood clots.

Elective surgeries are planned surgeries done in a new born child. Inguinal hernia is swelling seen in the groin of the child especially when the child cries or strains. It reduces when the child is sleeping. Surgery is required in the newborn period because there is a higher risk of complications in them such as obstruction of the small intestine requiring emergency surgery.
