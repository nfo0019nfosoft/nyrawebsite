          <p class="eye-text-extra">
             used to improve the safety, precision, and outcomes of cataract removal procedures. Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries globally and involves removing the cloudy lens of the eye and replacing it with an artificial lens implant. Advanced cataract surgery aims to provide patients with improved visual outcomes, faster recovery times, and reduced dependency on glasses or contact lenses, ultimately enhancing their quality of life. However, the suitability of these advanced techniques depends on various factors, including the patient's eye health, lifestyle, and preferences, and should be discussed with our qualified ophthalmologist Dr.Kirtana

          <p class="eye-text-extra">
         vision to individuals with corneal diseases or injuries. The cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye, plays a critical role in focusing your vision. When it's damaged through injury, disease, or infection, it can lead to vision problems or even blindness. Here's an overview of various corneal treatments, from conservative approaches to advanced surgical procedures: Advancements in corneal treatments continue to emerge, including novel drug therapies, gene therapy, and bioengineered corneas. These innovations aim to offer more effective, less invasive options for patients with corneal diseases, potentially improving outcomes and reducing the need for surgery. When dealing with corneal issues, the choice of treatment depends on the specific condition, its severity, and the patient's overall health. Our Qualified Ophthalmologist Dr.Kirtana can provide guidance on the best approach based on individual needs.

They are believed to be caused primarily by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, as well as by dry eye and environmental irritants such as dust and wind.
